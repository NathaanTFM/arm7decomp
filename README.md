# arm7decomp
decomp of the arm7 binary (mongoose)

So far I'm only reversing the wifi driver (NitroWireless/Marionea). Current names for I/O ports are from nocash (gbatek).

- twlsdk 5.5 mongoose_sub.sbin using types and names from mongoose_sub.nef

- marionea 2.88.00 which is used by many games and seems to be the latest version of the wifi driver

- not meant to be compiled back, only meant to figure out the driver works. still trying to make a 1:1 replica of every function, tho
